# V2.4 Improved Umbilical Mount and optional Y Endstop relocation

Another modification of one of HartK's parts along with modifying [Minsekt](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Minsekt)'s enstop relocation to fit better and more securly and remove the adjustability that wasn't needed.

* Added voron logo to umbilical mount
* Chamfer on umbilical threaded hole to make things easier to thread in.
* Versions of umbilical mount as standalone and a version modified to fit the endstop relocation.


## TODO:

* make PG7 version. Currently only M12 is available - DM me on discord if you need PG7 and I'll create it.
* Finish all-in-one endstop/umbilical mount
