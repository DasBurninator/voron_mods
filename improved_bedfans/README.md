The difference between running bedfans in the middle vs having a nevermore micro in the middle is somewhat significant. Lets do both and make sure those fans in the middle has as short of life as possible.

* These under the bed fan mounts mount between the bed rails. Similar to bed WAGO mounting.
* Available in single or dual fan.
* Wiring channels are run front and back for multiple routing options.

*Testing has yet to be done for more than a couple minutes. But it seems fine in my machine.*
